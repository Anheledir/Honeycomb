# Honeycomb

Project Honeycomb is a Discord bot, that is meant to provide artists some useful functions:
- creating a portfolio and showing random entries from it
- commission price-list
- commission queue
- allow users to add new commissions and filling out a form with necessary details
- allow users to add references with descriptions for their OCs
- loyalty points
- announcing new arts with references to different platforms (Twitter, DA, FA, Patreon, ...)
- progress tracking of commissions

Maybe there will also be some simple moderation-tools. But there are already enough bots specialized on that, so that's not in my focus for now.

There will be a hosted at some point, but can also be self-hosted within a Docker-Container.

Right now the project is in a ramp-up phase, so a lot of basic functionalities are added to the code, creating a solid base.
