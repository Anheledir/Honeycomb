Project Honeycomb is a Discord bot designed to provide artists with some useful functions to enhance their experience on Discord. With its features, artists can create a portfolio, display random entries from it, manage a commission price list, and keep track of their commission queue.

## Key Features

üëÄ Here are some planned key features of Project Honeycomb:

- **Portfolio Management:** Artists can create and manage their portfolio using the bot, and display random entries from their portfolio.
- **Commission Price List:** Artists can set up their commission price list using the bot, which will be displayed on demand.
- **Commission Queue Management:** Artists can keep track of their commission queue and manage their commissions using the bot.
- **Commission Request Form:** Users can request a commission by filling out a form with necessary details.
- **OC Reference Management:** Users can add references with descriptions for their OCs to easily access them when needed.
- **Loyalty Points:** Artists can reward their loyal customers by awarding loyalty points, which can be redeemed for future commissions.
- **Announcement of New Art:** Artists can announce their new artwork with references to different platforms like Twitter, DeviantArt, FurAffinity, Patreon, and more.
- **Progress Tracking of Commissions:** Artists can track the progress of their commissions using the bot.
- **Raffles:** Organize raffles on Discord or Twitter and randomly draw the winners.
- **Artist Discovery:** Opt-in to be discoverable when being open for commissions within a global catalogue.
